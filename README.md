# Introduction
This is a github for NCTU course "Selected Topics in Visual Recognition using Deep Learning" homework 3: Instance Segmentation.
I refer to facebook's contribution, detectron2.
All of my homework was completed and can be executed in Google colab.

The program I made in Google colab is also based on facebook detectron2's colab tuturial program.
